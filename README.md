# Puleng_ABSA_Assessment

The first step is to launch the browser, @beforeTest, then validate that the table is displayed @Test.

The program will add a new user and then clear the data before it add another user to avoid having two users added to the same coloumn.

I used timestamp to make sure that each username is unique.

The extendReportClass will give the results of the test after each run

The tools used are Maven, Selenium, ChromeDriver, excel, IntelliJ and Java Language

Make sure you run the program from Add_User_To_The_Table_Tests class
